# üö® IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

## **The Problem**
Your frontend at https://realtaste.pages.dev is trying to connect to `localhost:3001` instead of your deployed backend at `https://realtaste.fly.dev/api`.

## **The Evidence**
From the browser console errors:
```
realtaste.fly.dev/api/orders/undefined:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500
```

This shows the frontend is making API calls but with undefined order IDs.

## **The Fix (Choose One)**

### **Option A: Update Cloudflare Pages Environment Variables (Recommended)**

1. **Go to Cloudflare Dashboard**:
   - Visit: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
   - Login with your account
   - Go to "Pages" section
   - Find your "realtaste" project

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Click on your realtaste project
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Click "Environment variables"
   - Find `VITE_API_URL` or add it if missing
   - Set value to: `https://realtaste.fly.dev/api`
   - Click "Save"

3. **Redeploy**:
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Retry deployment" on the latest deployment
   - Wait for deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

### **Option B: Quick Local Test**

If you want to test locally first:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then test the payment flow locally.

### **Option C: Force Redeploy via Git**

```bash
# Make a small change to trigger redeploy
echo "# Updated API URL" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "fix: Update frontend to use deployed backend API"
git push origin main
```

## **How to Verify the Fix**

1. **Open Browser Dev Tools**:
   - Go to https://realtaste.pages.dev
   - Press F12 to open dev tools
   - Go to "Network" tab

2. **Test Order Creation**:
   - Add items to cart
   - Go to checkout
   - Fill in details and select "Card Payment"
   - Click "Place Order"

3. **Check Network Requests**:
   - In Network tab, you should see requests to `realtaste.fly.dev/api/orders`
   - NOT to `localhost:3001`

4. **Test PayHere Flow**:
   - After placing order, you should be redirected to PayHere sandbox
   - Use test card: `4111111111111111`
   - Complete payment
   - Should redirect back to your app

## **Expected Results After Fix**

‚úÖ **API calls go to deployed backend**
‚úÖ **Orders load correctly**  
‚úÖ **PayHere sandbox works end-to-end**
‚úÖ **No more console errors**
‚úÖ **Payment flow completes successfully**

## **Current Status**

- ‚úÖ **Backend**: Fully working with PayHere sandbox
- ‚ùå **Frontend**: Wrong API URL (needs environment variable update)
- üéØ **Next**: Update Cloudflare Pages environment variables

## **Need Help?**

If you're not sure how to access Cloudflare Pages dashboard:
1. Check your email for Cloudflare account details
2. Or let me know and I can guide you through the specific steps
3. The key is changing `VITE_API_URL` from localhost to the deployed backend URL

**This is a simple environment variable change - no code changes needed!**
