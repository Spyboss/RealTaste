# Cloudflare Pages redirects for React Router
# This ensures all routes are handled by the React app

# API proxy (optional - if you want to proxy API calls through Cloudflare)
# /api/* https://realtaste-api.fly.dev/api/:splat 200

# SPA fallback - all other routes should serve index.html
/* /index.html 200
